# PLAN & PLAY

*University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - UIUC  
Software Engineering II (CS428) Spring 2016 Final Project*  

### Project Description
Getting the capacity to rapidly organize and plan a sport activity with friends is difficult because of busy college schedules. Today, students use social media to ask their friends to join an activity, but this is not efficient especially if they need a big group where multiple layer messages are necessary to find and form a group to play with.  
  
PLAN & PLAN is a web application which addresses the problem by enabling its users to organize sports-related events without the burden of searching for others to participate. Users can search for activities in their area which they are interested in, join the events, and discover new friends with similar interests.
